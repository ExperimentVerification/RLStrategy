# RL based strategy for the iterated games

This is the implementation work for results verification.

For the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma part.
1. Run the RoundrobinTour.py for the round-robin tournament for the IPD. However, you will need to comment some of the lines or change the parameters according to the game settings mentioned.
2. Run the EcologicalTour.py for the ecological approach of evaluating the IPD strategies. It is also necessary to comment some lines and change some of the parameters if needed. 

For the iterated Double-Game Prisoner's Dilemma part.
Run the Tournament.py, which is the round-robin tournament for the DGPD, implemented according to Boyd's Material Versus Social Payoff Tournament.
