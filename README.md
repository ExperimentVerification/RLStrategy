* Run the [RoundrobinTour.py](https://github.com/ExperimentVerification/RLStrategy/blob/master/RLS4IPD/RoundrobinTour.py) for the round-robin tournament for the IPD. However, you will need to comment some of the lines or change the parameters according to the game settings mentioned.

* Run the EcologicalTour.py for the ecological approach of evaluating the IPD strategies. It is also necessary to comment some lines and change some of the parameters if needed.
